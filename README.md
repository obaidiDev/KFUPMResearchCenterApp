# KFUPMResearchCenterApp
Research Center Management System - Course Project
This course project aims to develop a comprehensive system for managing projects, teams, members, and machines at the KFUPM Research Center. We did it using JavaFX for the user interface, Scene Builder for designing the UI, Figma for prototyping, and MySQL for the database. The system will allow for efficient allocation of resources, scheduling of machine usage, and visualization of key metrics related to project and team activities.
Getting Started
We installed Java Development Kit (JDK) on our machines
Scene Builder for designing the UI
MySQL server installed and running, we used MySQL workbench and we connected it to java using jdbc.
Figma for prototyping
We then Set up the MySQL database and created all the needed tables.
After that, we started writing the queries that the below features require:
Admin Features
Add new projects and assign teams to them.
Add new members and assign them to teams.
Add new machines and manage their work schedules.
Visualize machine utilization, project-machine relationships, and member activity.
Member Features
View assigned teams and associated projects.
Access machine availability for team projects.
Reserve machines for specific project usage.
Then, we created the interface in Scene Builder and linked it with our code using FXML and controller classes.

Check our simple UI prototype. (Unfortunately, we lost some data from it).
